# Final-Project CSE210 

For this final project, I created a game where the user can shoot the enemy and get some points for it. The user also has health where whenever
the enemy goes through without being shot, the user loses some health points.
 
 I started by creating the size of the screen and the objective. I created the option where the objective controlled by the user would be able to
 shoot enemies that are randomly coming toward the object. Then I added the conditions of what would happen when the user destroys the enemies or 
 the enemies go through. Additionally, I worked on changing the levels of the game which means that the enemies would come faster and faster depending 
 on the number of points that the user has. Finally, I added a condition that whenever the user loses all his health points, a screen showing “game over” 
 would pop out.
 
 For exceeding the requirements, I added some beeps that would make it easier for the user to recognize when he was losing health points and when the game was over.
